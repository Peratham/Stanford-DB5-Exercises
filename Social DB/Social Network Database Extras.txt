Ans) select H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
from Likes L1, Likes L2, Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3
where L1.ID2 = L2.ID1
and L2.ID2 <> L1.ID1
and L1.ID1 = H1.ID and L1.ID2 = H2.ID and L2.ID2 = H3.ID;

Q2) Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades. 

Ans) select name, grade
from Highschooler, (
  select ID1 from Friend
  except
  -- students who have friends with same grade
  select distinct Friend.ID1
  from Friend, Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2
  where Friend.ID1 = H1.ID and Friend.ID2 = H2.ID
  and H1.grade = H2.grade
) as Sample
where Highschooler.ID = Sample.ID1;

Q3) What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.) 

Ans) select avg(count)
from (
  select count(ID2) as count
  from Friend
  group by ID1
) as FriendCount;

Q4) Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend. 

Ans) select count(distinct Fr1.ID2) + count(distinct Fr2.ID2)
from Friend Fr1, Friend Fr2, Highschooler
where Highschooler.name = 'Cassandra'
and Highschooler.ID = Fr1.ID1
-- reach friends of friends
and Fr1.ID2 = Fr2.ID1
-- except herself
and Fr2.ID1 <> Highschooler.ID
and Fr2.ID2 <> Highschooler.ID;

Q5) Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends.

from Highschooler, (
  select ID1 from Friend
  except
  -- student who has someone with more friends than them
  select distinct (FC1.ID1)
  from (
    select ID1, count(ID2) as FriendCount
    from Friend
    group by ID1
  ) as FC1,
  (
    select ID1, count(ID2) as FriendCount
    from Friend
    group by ID1
  ) as FC2
  where FC1.FriendCount < FC2.FriendCount
) as MaxFriend
where MaxFriend.ID1 = Highschooler.ID;
